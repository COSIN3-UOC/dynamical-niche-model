# Dynamical Niche Model
The codes in this repository present a minimal example to run simulations of the dynamical niche model of mutualistic online communication networks with external events. They are written for Matlab. The structural analysis was performed by employing customized code, which is publicly available at: https://github.com/COSIN3-UOC/nestedness_modularity_in-block_nestedness_analysis.
