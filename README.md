# Dynamical Niche Model
The code in this repository present a minimal example to run simulations of the dynamical niche model of mutualistic online communication networks with external events. The structural analysis was performed by employing customized code, which is publicly available at: https://github.com/COSIN3-UOC/nestedness_modularity_in-block_nestedness_analysis.
